### Todo

Ex4.1.c. 

Chap 5 of the BA book

Chap 2 of the BA book (in parallel)

### Done

4.3 to 4.5 of the Bandit Algorithm (BA) book. 

Proved Lemma 4.5

A bit of chap 2. Last time studying measure theory was about 2 year ago. The time before that was about 3 year ago. May this time be the last time I have to learn measure theory from scratch.

Busy packing for moving.

### Thoughts

1) Lemma 4.4: Isn't $\mathbb{P}(\mu_{A_t} = \mu^*)$ equivalent to $\mathbb{P}(A_t \in argmax_a \mu_a)$?
