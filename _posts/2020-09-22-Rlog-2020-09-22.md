### Todo

Chap 4 of the Bandit Algorithm (BA) book
Chap 2 of the BA book (in parallel)

### Done

Chap 1 of the BA book

A bit of chap 2.

### Thoughts

1) The competitor class is similar to the class of experts in online learning. The regret is also similar.

2) Suprised to see the definition of adversarial bandits: "drop all assumptions on how the rewards are generated,
except that they are chosen without knowledge of the learnerâ€™s actions and lie in a bounded set". Doesn't seem to be very adversarial. 

3) Any real websites using bandit algos for A/B testing?
